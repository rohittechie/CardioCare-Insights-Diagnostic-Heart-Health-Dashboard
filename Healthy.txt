Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis Dashboards

Introduction
The three provided dashboard images present an analysis of heart disease diagnostics using various visualizations and metrics. The dashboards are filtered by gender (Male, Female, and Combined) to analyze heart disease prevalence, chest pain types, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, ST depression, and age distribution. Below is a comparative analysis highlighting key insights.

1. Overview of the Dashboards
First Image (Male Only): Displays analysis specific to male patients.
Second Image (Female Only): Filters data to analyze only female patients.
Third Image (Combined - Both Genders): Provides an overall analysis incorporating both male and female data.

2. Key Comparisons and Insights

Heart Disease Distribution
Males (First Image):

206 cases of heart disease.
92 cases where heart disease is absent.
Males have a higher prevalence of heart disease in the dataset.
Females (Second Image):

97 cases of heart disease.
25 cases where heart disease is absent.
The proportion of females diagnosed with heart disease is high (74.23% present, 25.77% absent).
Combined (Third Image):

303 total cases of heart disease (206 males, 97 females).
139 cases where heart disease is absent.
Males have a significantly higher absolute number of cases, but females show a higher percentage of affected individuals.
ðŸ“Œ Insight: While more males have heart disease in absolute numbers, females exhibit a higher relative percentage of heart disease presence.


Chest Pain Experienced

Males:
Higher cases of asymptomatic chest pain.
Lower cases of typical angina.
Females:

More cases of non-anginal pain.
Typical angina cases are slightly higher than in males.
Combined:

Asymptomatic cases are the most prevalent across both genders.
The distribution of chest pain varies between genders.
ðŸ“Œ Insight: Males experience more asymptomatic chest pain, leading to a risk of undetected heart disease, while females report more non-anginal pain.
 
Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, and Max Heart Rate
Males:

Higher blood pressure values.
Cholesterol levels are significantly higher.
Max heart rate values are greater than in females.
Females:

Cholesterol values are relatively lower.
Max heart rate is slightly lower than in males.
Blood pressure values are less extreme.
Combined:

Blood pressure, cholesterol, and max heart rate are higher overall due to the dominant male presence in the dataset.
ðŸ“Œ Insight: Males tend to have higher risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol, which can contribute to a higher likelihood of heart disease.

ST Depression by Age
Males:

Significant peaks in ST depression values around ages 50-60.
Higher maximum values of ST depression compared to females.
Females:

ST depression peaks around ages 55-65, but values are generally lower than in males.
Combined:

Follows a similar pattern but with a more balanced curve.
ðŸ“Œ Insight: ST depression levels tend to peak in older individuals, with males exhibiting more extreme values.

Age Distribution
Males:
Most cases are around ages 50-60, with some data up to age 80.
Females:

Higher concentration around ages 55-65.
Combined:

Data follows a similar trend but shows the variation in gender-specific age distributions.
ðŸ“Œ Insight: The majority of heart disease cases are found in individuals aged 50-65, with slight variations between genders.

3 Conclusion and Key Takeaways
Heart Disease Prevalence:

More males are affected in absolute numbers.
Females show a higher percentage of affected individuals.
Risk Factors:

Males have higher blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
Females report more non-anginal chest pain, while males are often asymptomatic.
Age Trends:

Heart disease is most common in individuals aged 50-65.
ST depression spikes are more extreme in males.
Clinical Implications:

For males: Preventative screening is essential, especially for asymptomatic cases.
For females: Awareness is needed as symptoms can be atypical.
