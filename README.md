Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis Dashboards

The Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of heart disease prevalence across different genders. It visualizes key metrics such as heart disease distribution, chest pain types, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, max heart rate, ST depression, and age distribution. The analysis highlights that males have a higher absolute number of heart disease cases, while females show a higher relative percentage of affected individuals. Males tend to experience more asymptomatic chest pain, whereas females report more non-anginal pain. Additionally, blood pressure, cholesterol, and max heart rate levels are generally higher in males, contributing to increased risk factors. ST depression is more pronounced in individuals aged 50-65, with males exhibiting sharper peaks. The age distribution analysis shows that heart disease cases peak between 50-65 years for both genders. These findings emphasize the importance of early detection, gender-specific diagnostic approaches, and preventive healthcare strategies.
